<p class="ptext">During high school, I have found (and often still do) myself making websites for various clubs. So far, I have helped work on 2 websites for 2 different clubs. One was for the Game and Animation Club (AKA G/A Club), made entirely from scratch, and one was for my school's athletics program (AKA d.athletics), which was made alongside a team of club members.</p>

<p class="ptext">The home page of the Game and Animation (AKA G/A club) website. My main design inspiration came from using gradients and organic shapes to make the first thing you see feel unique. I also created the illustration shown.</p>

<p class="ptext">This website for the d.athletics team was made with a few other team members on Wix. It was much easier to collaborate on and create something that looked good on Wix, but it doesn't allow for as much control than doing it from scratch. The picture shown above is the site's landing page.</p>
