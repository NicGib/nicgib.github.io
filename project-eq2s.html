<p class="ptext">Through the <a class="onwhite" target="blank" href="http://www.scu.edu/engineering/frugal/">Frugal Innovation Hub</a> at Santa Clara University, Nicolas worked with the local company <a class="onwhite" target="blank" href="https://equation2success.com/">Equation2Success</a>, translating and visualizing Equation2Success' initial goals into a real-world app aimed for implementation at local LA schools.

Nicolas designed the Figma app wireframe with 2 teammates, and iterated the app based upon Equation2Success & FIH team member feedback through weekly meetings.

"Public elementary and middle schools in the US encounter multiple challenges to better serve their students. From financial problems to a lack of infrastructure to internal information management. The Equation2Sucess app seeks to provide a technological tool for elementary and middle schools located in disenfranchised areas of L.A., California. USA to identify and keep track of internal cases of students such as bullying, academic deficiencies, or classroom issues. The app will also track and share successful cases where issues got solved so best practices can be shared The goal of the app is to build a community support network within schools that involves all stakeholders to solve studentsâ€™ issues."

<h4 class="ptext-subheader">Equation2Success Pitch Video</h4>
<p class="ptext">
After the development of the app visualization, Nicolas was called upon to develop and create a pitch video for the app using the Figma prototype.
<br><br>
In this project, Nicolas determined the necessary features to showcase whilst considering time constraints and the audience of the video (potential stakeholders for the app). He created a general outline and a shotlist and recorded all app screens using OBS software. He wrote a voiceover script and recorded it himself using a professional mic and OBS. Using Premiere Pro, Nicolas cleaned up the recorded audio and created custom phone mockup and text animations to grab the user's attention. He consistently kept a clean and professional look throughout the video. Finally, Nicolas created the video's thumbnail and presented the final video to Equation2Success. Throughout the whole process, Nicolas consistently asked the company for feedback, and updated the video's showcased features, script, visuals, and thumbnail according to the comments received.
<br><br>
In the end, Nicolas consistently communicated with Equation2Success to deliver a concise and clear video that explains the main features and purpose of the EQ2S app, educating and engaging stakeholders for future interest and investment in the project.
