<p class="ptext">For about 3 years, Nicolas took piano lessons through MPMA, the Mid-Peninnsula Music Academy. He has had two teachers so far, both of which were instrumental in helping him increase his skill in piano playing, reading, and compositions.</p>
<div class="pdivider-small"></div>
<p class="ptext">Nicolas' first main project involved creating a group of four miniatures to be played by a English horn and Oboe duo. Titled "Bluer Oceans", he took inspiration from his favorite soundtracks. For example, the piece "Field" was heavily inspired by the ambient "Field - Day" track from <em>The Legend of Zelda : Breath of the Wild</em>. Other pieces in this collection were originally made around certain prompted themes from his teacher, before being adapted into the overall collection.</p>
<div class="pdivider-small"></div>
<p class="ptext">Piano Suite No.1 Op.2 is similar to Bluer Oceans in that it contains several later adapted pieces. Although there are only 3 pieces in this suite, "Jagged Mountains" is an especially long piece which the previous 2 pieces build up to. Drawing from experience with Bluer Oceans, Nicolas improved the consistency between pieces to focus more on the overall feeling of the pieces combined. The title page was an aspect he especially focused on—the presentation shaping the listening experience of the pieces themselves. <em>This piece was later performed and recorded by pianist <a class="onwhite" target="blank" href="https://musicacademy.org/iox-profiles/forrest-howell/">Forrest Howell</a>, a friend of Nicolas' teacher.</em></p>
