  Nicolas has worked with the Design Tech High School yearbook team for three years, starting as an Academics page designer in sophomore year. The following two years, he moved through the leadership positions of Section Editor and Co-Editor in Chief respectively. 
  <br><br>
  As a page designer, Nicolas designed the layout for every page within the Academics section, which also included setting the final photography and writing. Throughout the process, many revisions would take place, as new pictures and updated text come in gradually during the school year.
  <br><br>
  As a Section Editor the following year, Nicolas supervised, communicated with, and coordinated page designers, photographers, and copywriters for the Academics section of the yearbook. He also made sure to adjust to the new virtual environment of that year by communicating often and hosting meetings for designers.
  <br><br>
  During his senior year, Nicolas acted as one of two co-editors in chief for The Flame. Managing all Section Editors for each yearbook section, he taught leadership and design skills, as well as initiated discussion, collaboration, and voting on large-scale design decisions. He consistently communicated with all yearbook members and gave updates to d.tech admin. Furthermore, he hosted weekly meetings, and structured & ran a 2-week student-led Yearbook Intersession class along with the 2nd Co-Editor. Finally, he managed the publication process of the yearbook, including communicating with the publisher, financial management, and leading in-person distribution.
