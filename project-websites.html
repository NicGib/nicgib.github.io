<p class="ptext">During high school Nicolas found himself making websites for 2 different clubs. One made from scratch for the Game and Animation Club (AKA G/A Club), and the other for Design Tech High School's official athletics program, d.athletics, which was made alongside a team of club members.</p>

<p class="ptext">For the landing page, Nicolas' main design inspiration came from using gradients and organic shapes to make the first thing you see feel unique. He also designed the club's logo and the digital illustration found on the homepage.</p>

<p class="ptext">This website for the d.athletics team was made with a few other team members on Wix. It was easier to collaborate on and create something that looked good on Wix, but it doesn't allow for as much control than doing it from scratch. The picture shown above is the site's landing page.</p>
